# a-star-pathfinding
This was a project that was created for the AP Computer Science Principles Create Performance Task.

It implements the A* Pathfinding Algorithm in JavaScript and allows the user to visualize the algorithm in action.

A demo of the project can be found here:
https://anish-shanbhag.github.io/a-star-pathfinding/src/aStar

You can place obstacles using the "Place Obstacles" button, then place a target using the "Place Target" button. The pink circle will pathfind to the green target while avoiding the black obstacles.
